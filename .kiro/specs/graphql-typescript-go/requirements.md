# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating a GraphQL API system that connects a TypeScript frontend with a Go (Golang) backend. The system will provide a type-safe, efficient communication layer between the client and server, leveraging GraphQL's query flexibility and Go's performance characteristics. The integration should support real-time data fetching, mutations, subscriptions, and maintain strong type safety across the entire stack.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to query data from the Go backend using GraphQL with full TypeScript type safety, so that I can build robust client applications with compile-time error checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript client makes a GraphQL query THEN the system SHALL return properly typed data matching the GraphQL schema
2. WHEN GraphQL schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically generate updated TypeScript types
3. WHEN invalid queries are written THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time errors in TypeScript
4. WHEN GraphQL operations are executed THEN the system SHALL provide IntelliSense and autocompletion in the IDE
5. IF a query requests non-existent fields THEN the system SHALL return GraphQL validation errors
6. WHEN nested queries are made THEN the system SHALL resolve relationships efficiently without N+1 problems

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to implement GraphQL resolvers in Go with automatic schema generation, so that I can maintain type safety and reduce boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Go structs are defined with GraphQL tags THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the GraphQL schema
2. WHEN resolver functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL map them to the appropriate GraphQL operations
3. WHEN GraphQL queries are received THEN the system SHALL validate them against the generated schema
4. WHEN resolver errors occur THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted GraphQL error responses
5. IF invalid input is provided to mutations THEN the system SHALL validate and return appropriate error messages
6. WHEN the Go server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the GraphQL schema at the designated endpoint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a full-stack developer, I want to perform CRUD operations through GraphQL mutations with optimistic updates, so that users experience responsive interactions while maintaining data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mutation is executed from TypeScript THEN the system SHALL update the Go backend and return the modified data
2. WHEN optimistic updates are enabled THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI before server confirmation
3. WHEN mutation errors occur THEN the system SHALL revert optimistic updates and display error messages
4. WHEN concurrent mutations happen THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts appropriately
5. IF network connectivity is lost during mutations THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry
6. WHEN mutations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL update the Apollo Client cache automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want real-time data updates through GraphQL subscriptions, so that I can see live changes without manual refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes on the Go backend THEN the system SHALL push updates to subscribed TypeScript clients
2. WHEN clients subscribe to data changes THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connections
3. WHEN subscription data is received THEN the system SHALL update the TypeScript client state automatically
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
5. IF subscription authentication fails THEN the system SHALL close the connection and return auth errors
6. WHEN multiple clients are subscribed THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all relevant subscribers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling across the GraphQL integration, so that I can debug issues effectively and provide good user experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with error codes
2. WHEN network errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return field-specific error messages
4. WHEN server errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed information without exposing sensitive data
5. IF authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL redirect users to login appropriately
6. WHEN errors are displayed to users THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GraphQL integration to be performant and secure, so that the application can handle production workloads safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL queries are executed THEN the system SHALL implement query complexity analysis to prevent abuse
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens on both client and server
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL implement proper authorization checks
4. WHEN queries are made THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to improve performance
5. IF malicious queries are detected THEN the system SHALL block them and log security events
6. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 500ms for simple queries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code generation and development tools, so that I can maintain consistency and productivity across the TypeScript-Go GraphQL integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GraphQL schema changes THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate TypeScript types
2. WHEN Go code changes THEN the system SHALL update the GraphQL schema automatically
3. WHEN development server starts THEN the system SHALL provide GraphQL Playground for testing
4. WHEN queries are written THEN the system SHALL provide linting and formatting tools
5. IF schema mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages during build
6. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL validate schema compatibility between frontend and backend
