# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a backend API system for the Nuculo software consulting website. The backend will support the existing React frontend by providing APIs for contact form submissions, service inquiries, content management, and basic analytics. The system should be scalable, secure, and maintainable to support the company's business operations and potential future growth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential client visiting the website, I want to submit contact inquiries through the contact form, so that I can get in touch with Nuculo for their services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the contact form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, email, message)
2. WHEN form validation passes THEN the system SHALL store the contact submission in the database
3. WHEN a contact submission is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the company
4. WHEN a contact submission is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL send an auto-reply confirmation email to the user
5. IF the email address format is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
6. IF any required field is missing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Nuculo team member, I want to manage and view contact submissions through an admin interface, so that I can follow up with potential clients effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN an authenticated admin views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all contact submissions with timestamps
3. WHEN an admin views a contact submission THEN the system SHALL show all submitted details (name, email, message, submission date)
4. WHEN an admin marks a submission as "contacted" THEN the system SHALL update the submission status
5. WHEN an admin searches submissions THEN the system SHALL filter results by name, email, or date range
6. IF an unauthenticated user tries to access admin features THEN the system SHALL redirect to login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Nuculo administrator, I want to manage the services content displayed on the website, so that I can keep the service offerings up-to-date without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new service THEN the system SHALL store the service with title, description, and icon identifier
2. WHEN an admin updates a service THEN the system SHALL modify the existing service data
3. WHEN an admin deletes a service THEN the system SHALL remove it from the active services list
4. WHEN the frontend requests services data THEN the system SHALL return all active services in the correct order
5. WHEN an admin reorders services THEN the system SHALL update the display order accordingly
6. IF a service has invalid data THEN the system SHALL return validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the website to load quickly with up-to-date service information, so that I can easily understand what Nuculo offers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests services data THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms under normal load
2. WHEN services data is requested THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON with all service details
3. WHEN the services API is called THEN the system SHALL implement caching to improve performance
4. IF the services API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them without performance degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Nuculo business owner, I want to track basic website analytics and contact form performance, so that I can understand user engagement and optimize the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the system SHALL record analytics data (timestamp, user agent, referrer)
2. WHEN an admin views the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display contact submission trends over time
3. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL show metrics like daily/weekly/monthly submission counts
4. WHEN the analytics API is called THEN the system SHALL aggregate data without exposing personal information
5. IF analytics data is requested for a specific date range THEN the system SHALL filter results accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to be secure and reliable, so that client data is protected and the system remains available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint receives a request THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
2. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it at rest
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and required environment variables
6. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
7. WHEN user data is handled THEN the system SHALL comply with basic data protection practices
